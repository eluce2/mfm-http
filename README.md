## Breaking Change in 2.0.0 - sort of

2.0.0 technically has a breaking change but it is highly unlikly to cause problems.
In 1.9.1 we added `response.Ok` property to the response as fast way to check if a response was in the 200 range. Version 2.0.0 changes that to `response.ok`, SO if you never used that feature that is only a couple of months old, you will not be impacted by this change.

# Version History

## v2.0.1
- **Date:** 3/18/2025
- **Author:** Todd Geist (todd.geist@proofgeist.com)

## v2.0.0
- **Change:** Changed `response.Ok` to `response.ok` to better match standards from other fetch libraries. This is technically a breaking change, which is why the version is updated to 2.0.0. However, it would likely only affect users who started using the `.ok` feature, which probably no one besides the author has.
